# bgp-extended-nexthop

This configuration extends the [bgp-simple](../bgp-simple/) test by enabling
BGP peering over IPv6 link-local addresses with the extended next-hop capability.

This feature allows routers to advertise routes with next-hop addresses from different
address families, improving flexibility in multi-protocol environments.
